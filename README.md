# Data Visualization Homework 3

Building a full visualization pipeline that requires data to be served dynamically based on user interactions on the front-end. Your task is to reproduce the visualization with a user interface that allows users to enter a zip code, and then show the distribution of cuisine within that zip code. 

The data source is the same as in the previous homework:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hvo/datasets/master/nyc_restaurants_by_cuisine.json
